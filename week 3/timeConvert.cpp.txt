Programming Project #4

Problem Statement: 
The gravitational attractive force between two bodies with masses m1 and m2 seperated 
by a distance d is given by the following formula: 

F = (G*m1*m2)/(d^2)

where G is the universal gravitational constant: 

G = 6.673x10-8 cm^3/(g*sec^2)

Write a function definition that takes arguments for the masses of the two bodies and
the distance between them and returns the gravitational force between them. Since you
will use the above formula, the gravitational force will be in dynes. One dyne equals a

1 dyne = (g*cm)/(sec^2)

You should use a globally defined constant for the universal gravity constant. Embed
your function definition into a complete program that computes the gravitational force
between two objects given suitable inputs. Your program should allow the user to repeat
the calculation as often as the user wishes.
