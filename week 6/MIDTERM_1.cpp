MIDTERM PART 1_A

PROBLEM STATEMENT
1.	Write the following program
a.	 C program,  Point.c , that declares the following Point structure

struct Point{
	int X, Y;	//position
	float R;	// radius - distance from origin
};
The program contains the following Accessor functions:
"	void setData(struct Point*, int u, int v)
"	float getRadius(struct Point*);
"	void ScalePoint(struct Point *, int scale)

"	The program should create a Point P1 at X=3, Y=4;
"	The program should output Radius of P1
"	The program should scale point P1 by 5
"	The program should output the Radius of scaled P1
