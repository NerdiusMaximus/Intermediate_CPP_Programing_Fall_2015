MIDTERM PART 1_A

PROBLEM STATEMENT
1.	Write the following program
b.	A C++ program, Point.cpp,  that declares the following Point structure

struct Point{
	int X, Y;	//position
	float R;	// radius - distance from origin 

// member functions
	void setData(int u, int v);
float getRadius()const;
void ScalePoint( int scale);

};
The program contains the following Accessor member functions:

"	The program should create a Point P1 at X=3, Y=4;
"	The program should output Radius of P1
"	The program should scale point P1 by 5
"	The program should output the Radius of scaled P1
"
